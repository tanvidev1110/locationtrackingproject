Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/tanvidev1110/locationtrackingproject.git
Open the project in Android Studio.

Make sure you have the required permissions in your AndroidManifest.xml for location access and background service:

xml
Copy
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION" />
Sync the project with Gradle to download dependencies.

Usage
The location tracking service starts automatically when the app is launched.
The app uses LiveData/Flow to show the current location on the UI.
If running on Android 12+, the app will request permission for background location access.
Geofencing can be configured in the app to trigger events (e.g., showing notifications) when the user enters or exits a specific geographic area.
Features & Details
1. Location Tracking with Fused Location Provider:
The Fused Location Provider API provides a simple and efficient way to retrieve the user's location, optimizing accuracy and battery usage.
2. Foreground Service:
To ensure location updates continue in the background, the app uses a Foreground Service with a persistent notification, making the service visible to the user.
3. LiveData / Flow:
LiveData or Flow is used to update the UI reactively. Whenever the location changes, the UI will be updated with the new coordinates.
4. Battery Optimization:
The app uses WorkManager to manage background tasks related to location updates. Work Constraints are applied to optimize battery consumption by limiting updates based on specific conditions (e.g., network connectivity, battery status).
5. Android 12+ Compliance:
The app adheres to the Android 12+ background restrictions. It requests the ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION permission in addition to the standard ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION for proper functionality in the background.
Geofencing Implementation (Optional)
To implement Geofencing in this project, follow these steps:

Add Geofences: Create Geofence objects that define a specific geographical area (latitude, longitude, and radius).

Add Geofence PendingIntent: Set a PendingIntent that will be triggered when the user enters or exits the geofence.

Monitor Geofence Events: Implement a GeofenceBroadcastReceiver to handle geofence transitions (enter/exit events).

Start Geofence Monitoring: Use GeofencingClient to start geofence monitoring in the background.

Additional Notes:
Ensure that you have appropriate permissions to access location data.
Geofencing is an optional feature, but you can enable it by configuring the relevant geofence areas and using the GeofencingClient API.
This app follows best practices for battery optimization using WorkManager and location fetching using Fused Location Provider.
